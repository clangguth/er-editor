# Entity Relationship Editor

This is a fork of the original ER Editor by Gert Helsen [published here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ereditor/).

### Changes from the original version:

 * can run as a standalone .jar file
 * more pleasant UI: enables colors and smoothing by default, uses [Nimbus](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/lookandfeel/nimbus.html) Look and Feel if possible
